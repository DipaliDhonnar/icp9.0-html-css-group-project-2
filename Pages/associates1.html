   <h2 style="color:indianred; font-size:40px;">Bajiprabhu Deshpande : True devotee of Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
   <div class="box">
   <p> <b>For any true Hindu and a lover of Bharath Varsh, the study of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharajâ€™s life is awe-inspiring.  Over and above being a great and ferocious warrior and in many ways a fore-runner in counter-Jehadi-terrorism  in 17th century Bharath, Shivaji was a devoted son to his mother Jijau , a devoted Seeker (Bhakt) of Goddess Bhavani, and a champion protector of the weak and innocent. The daring exploits of this proud Maratha warrior king are extra-ordinary.

    And in many of his exploits, Shivaji Maharaj had the valiant support and extraordinary sacrifices of his courageous men, who put the command and the dream of their leader for establishment of HINDAVI SWARAJ (Hindu Kingdom) over and above everything else they cherished and that included their personal possessions and families and one such extraordinary warrior was the great Baji Prabhu Deshpanade, the one such brave heart who selflessly sacrificed his life to save life of his king Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj.<b></p>

        <h2 style="color:indianred; font-size:40px;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <div class="box">
        <p><b> Bajiprabhu Deshpande was born into the CKP caste (Chandrasainya Kayastha Prabhu) caste of scribes. But from a young age Bajiprabhu Deshpande had a martial spirit in him. In those days India was suffering from the tyranny of the Mughals . Bajiprabhu Deshpande wanted to serve his country and help liberate it from the Mughal yoke. The rise of Shivaji Maharaj gave Bajiprabhu Deshpande the opportunity he was seeking.

            Shivaji Maharaj, seeing the intense love for the motherland in Bajiprabhu Deshpande gave him military command of south Maharashtra around the Kolhapur region.  Bajiprabhu Deshpande played an important role when the fearsome General Afzal Khan was sent by the Adilshahi king to slay Shivaji Maharaj and destroy the fledgling Maratha Kingdom. Bajiprabhu Deshpande brought with him a few select band of Maratha warriors who included Visaji Murambak who was as tall and heavily built as Afzal Khan. Shivaji Maharaj practiced the duel with Afzal Khan using Visaji as his sparring partner.</b>

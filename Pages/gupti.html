                Gupti, also known as the hidden dagger, was a weapon that was favoured by Shivaji Maharaj. The Gupti was a small and lightweight dagger that was designed to be hidden and easily concealable, making it an ideal tool for assassinations and surprise attacks.


The Gupti was typically made of high-quality steel and had a sharp, pointed blade that was only a few inches long. The handle of the Gupti was often intricately decorated with gold or silver, reflecting Shivaji Maharaj’s status as a warrior king.

Shivaji Maharaj was known for his use of the Gupti in combat. He would often use the weapon to deliver surprise attacks on his opponents, targeting vital areas such as the throat or heart. The Gupti was particularly effective in close-quarters combat, where its small size and concealability gave Shivaji Maharaj an advantage over his opponents.

One of the advantages of the Gupti was its versatility. The weapon could be used for both offensive and defensive purposes, allowing Shivaji Maharaj to deflect attacks and disarm opponents. The small size of the Gupti also meant that it could be used as a throwing weapon, making it an effective tool in ranged combat as well. The Gupti was also an important symbol of Shivaji Maharaj’s authority. The weapon was often used in coronation ceremonies, where it symbolized the king’s power and ability to defend his people. Kataar, also known as the push dagger or punching dagger, was a weapon that was commonly used in India during the medieval period. The Kataar consisted of a short blade that was mounted perpendicular to a handle, allowing it to be thrust forward like a punch.The Kataar was typically made of high-quality steel and was designed to be strong and durable. The blade was usually sharpened on both edges, making it an effective cutting and piercing weapon.

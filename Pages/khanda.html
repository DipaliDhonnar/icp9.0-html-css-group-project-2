                It also known as Khanjarli or Katar, is a type of dagger or short sword used by the Maratha warriors during the reign of Shivaji Maharaj. It is a thrusting weapon that features a triangular or diamond-shaped blade that is designed to penetrate armor and deliver fatal blows.The Khanjar has a straight blade that typically measures around 12 to 18 inches in length. The blade is double-edged, which allows for both thrusting and slashing attacks. The handle of the Khanjar is typically made of wood or ivory and is designed to provide a secure grip for the wielder. The handle may also be adorned with intricate designs or precious stones to reflect the wealth and status of the owner.The Khanjar was a popular weapon among the Maratha soldiers due to its ability to penetrate armor and deliver fatal blows. It was often used as a secondary weapon, worn alongside a larger sword or spear. The Khanjar was particularly effective in close-quarters combat, where the Maratha warriors could use its stabbing and thrusting attacks to quickly incapacitate their opponents Shivaji Maharaj recognized the importance of the Khanjar in battle and encouraged his soldiers to train in its use. Just like all other weapons of Shivaji Maharaj, Khanjar was widely used by the Maratha army and became an important tool in their success in battle. The Khanjar was also a symbol of Maratha bravery and courage, and many Maratha soldiers were proud to carry the weapon into battle.

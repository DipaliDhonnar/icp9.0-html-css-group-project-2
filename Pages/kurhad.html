                Kurhaad, also known as a war hammer or mace, was another weapon that was a part of Shivaji Maharaj’s arsenal. The Kurhaad was a heavy and powerful weapon that could crush bones and break armor, making it an effective tool in battle.The Kurhaad consisted of a long handle made of wood or metal with a heavy head on one end. The head of the Kurhaad was typically made of iron or steel and could have a variety of shapes, including spherical, cylindrical, or pyramid-shaped.Shivaji Maharaj was known for his skill in using the Kurhaad in combat. He would often use the weapon to strike his opponents with great force, causing severe damage and even death. The Kurhaad was particularly effective against armoured opponents, as the heavy head could crush through even the toughest armor.One of the unique features of the Kurhaad was its versatility. The weapon could be used in a variety of ways, including as a bludgeoning tool or as a piercing weapon. Shivaji Maharaj would use the Kurhaad to deliver powerful blows to his opponents, often targeting the head or limbs.Another advantage of the Kurhaad was its weight. The heavy head of the weapon could be used to knock opponents off balance, leaving them vulnerable to follow-up attacks. Shivaji Maharaj would often use the Kurhaad to create openings in his opponents’ defences, allowing him to strike with other weapons or techniques.In addition to its use in combat, the Kurhaad also had ceremonial significance. It was often used in processions and ceremonies, symbolizing Shivaji Maharaj’s power and authority.
